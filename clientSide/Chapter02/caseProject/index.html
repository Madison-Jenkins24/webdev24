        <p>Welcome to my website! I will be discussing some of my favorite
            games. These are games that I enjoy playing and could play for
            hours. Some games are multiplayer, others are singleplayer. I
            highly recommend these games if they fit your preferences or 
            if you are searching for new things to play.
